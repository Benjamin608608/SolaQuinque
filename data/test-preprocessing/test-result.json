      "text": "_Incendium Amoris,_ translated as _The Fire of Love,_ was written by Richard Rolle. Rolle was an author, a hermit, and an English mystic who lived from 1300 to 1349. This work chronicles Rolle's experiences as a mystic. Here, he describes three specific kinds of experiences. The first is a physical feeling of warmth throughout his body. Secondly, his senses are bathed with sweetness. The last mystic experience is audibly hearing music that only heaven could produce while he recites various Psalms. Getting closer to God is a goal of mysticism, and these experiences are directly associated with the stages of that process.\n\nSource: Wikipedia | **Born:** January 1, 1290   \n---|---  \n**Died:** January 1, 1349   \n**Related topics:** …",

      "text": "Of Justification by Faith & Works is a dialogue between two opposing viewpoints on the doctrine of Justification. On one side, William Law develops the Wesleyan teaching of justification through faith alone. This character is referred to as a Methodist. The other character, reflecting Law's belief more closely, argues that Justification requires faith and work. This character is named Churchman. This book was published in 1760.
